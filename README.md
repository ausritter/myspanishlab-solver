A browser extention for the Safari browser that will automatically solve SAM problems from MySpanishLab from Pearson Education.

This application was created as a proof-of-concept to show how insecure the MySpanishLab suite of applications are. These applications are commonly required in college Spanish courses and are based on brittle and old code, with very specifc browser requirements.

**Note: this application cannot be used to cheat in any way, as the answers to SAM activites are provided in the application itself (just hidden until several failed attempts). I absolutely do not encourage or condone academic dishonesty.**
